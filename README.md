# PY4E-taken-notes-and-exercises-
This repository contains notes taken chapter by chapter and exercises, which are mainly based on professor C. Severance's PY4E (A specialization in Python) courses. 
Each chapter's notes and examples are organized in folders. There is an extra folder called 'Practice Exercises', which includes some examples (from his 'py4e' book), many of them based on professor Severance's examples, others taken from the internet.
